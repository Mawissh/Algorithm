This paper presents a novel quantum image encryption–steganography framework that integrates a memristor-based Hopfield neural network (mHNN) with an optimal least significant bit (LSB)-based quantum steganography scheme. The proposed mHNN model overcomes the limitations of conventional low-dimensional chaotic systems by providing enhanced dynamical complexity and improved randomness. To strengthen diffusion and resistance against chosen-plaintext attacks, a multi-layer quantum diffusion strategy is employed, which applies a dynamically constructed 2D semi-magic matrix generated from randomly selected layers of a magic cube. The encryption process is implemented using fundamental quantum gates such as CNOT and CCNOT. For secure information hiding, an LSB-based quantum steganography method is adopted, effectively mitigating the vulnerabilities of LSB techniques while preserving high visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate strong encryption performance, with near-ideal information entropy (≥ 7.999) and excellent steganographic imperceptibility, achieving PSNR values above 54 dB. Comprehensive comparative analysis further confirms that the proposed framework outperforms several recent state-of-the-art quantum image encryption and steganography schemes, highlighting its effectiveness for secure quantum image transmission.

The accompanying repository includes experimental results for a variety of publicly available test images, along with detailed evaluations under multiple security and robustness metrics.
